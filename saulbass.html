    <p>
        Saul bass is often regarded as the most accomplished graphic designer in history.

This innovative designer is best known for the introduction of graphic design in the world of cinematography and his recognisable corporate logo design. 
        Bass developed a style that was considered unique and modernist for his time, due to the rough and unpolished look of his work, predominantly seen Throughout his film sequence works.
        Bass ability to evolve as an artist, adapting his visions to a huge range of material is what sets him apart from other designers of his time. He has massively influenced modern design and has left behind a lasting legacy on the graphic design community.

        <h2>Early Work</h2>
        <p>
            Born in 1920s New York, Saul Bass was creative in his youth, attending night classes at the Art Students League where he studied under György Kepes, a master of the ‘functional Bauhaus aesthetic’. Kepes and the Bauhaus became a large influence in bass later work.

            <p>In bass early days he took on small projects building up a plethora of works some of which are still regarded as ‘classics’. chevrons for aircraft tails, Art & Architecture magazine covers, record covers, the most notable being Tone Poems of Colour by Sinatra record cover and posters of Chaplin`s Monsieur Verdoux tragicomedy are examples of many others. 
                Saul Bass & Associates company was opened in 1952 due to the amount of work bass was producing. Continuing his work bass was releasing independent projects under this company until his first major break in 1954 which kickstarted his career and the work that he’s famous for today.

            <h2>Art of the Title</h2>
            <p>The role of films title credits, completely revolutionised. In 1954 Saul bass was hired by otto Preminger to design the film titles for the 1954 film Carmen Jones, this was the start of a new era within cinema. Originally considered unimportant, static and boring, the movie credits were usually projected onto the closed curtain, rarely to be seen by the audience. Bass changed this. With his distinctive minimal style and the introduction of the new Swiss style, bass made the film title sequence an integral part or the experience and held it to the same artistic value as the poster and film itself. When it came to the title and poster design Bass is known for using a more iconographic approach, with the intent to set the mood and introduce the themes before anything else.
                With his first film project the delivery of the movie themes was not achieved as well as hoped, therefore Bass approached his next film title, and others to follow, with the same three point approach he would use with any other design project.

                <blockquote>1.	He saturated himself with knowledge of the company.
                    2.	He made sure he understood the vision of the company.
                    3.	He didn’t try to symbolize a point of view.                         
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>He achieved a much more successful approach in his next film for otto Preminger, ‘a man with a golden arm’, one of his most famous film works. He worked with Preminger to create the vision of representing the reality of drug addiction without judging the morals of the main character. Bass liked to challenge the audiences view of this topic. he sandwiched the credits between a series of straight and asymmetrical lines. By the time they came together to form the iconic image of a jagged arm. In traditional Bass fashion the title sequence remains minimalistic consisting of solely white imagery on a black background, a tool used to capture the attention of the audience.</p>
                        
                        <p>This was only the kick start for bass career in film, continuing through the 50s and 60s to stretch the boundaries in technology and his own art work.
                        Bass went on to work with Alfred Hitchcock and created what could be considered as his most recognisable work. Bass created posters and film credits for numerous of Hitchcock’s projects, notably including the great Vertigo, North by Northwest and Psycho. For these projects bass began to introduce the new technique of kinetic typography combined with his usual techniques inspired by new Swiss style. With letters dashing and moving across the screen and frequently incorporating images other than text an even more detailed and enjoyable experience for the audience was created.
                        </p>
                        <p>What could be describes as bass signature colour theory is used throughout these works. His understanding of the power colour holds as a design tool is evident in his chosen colour pallets.
                            Simple but vivid with no more than three of four colours ‘Simplicity with impact’, Red, white, and black is one of the golden colour combinations that Bass put to use many times. His use of these sharp, striking colour combos create engaging visuals for audiences. Audience involvement in many cases begins with colour, something that bass was well aware of when creating his works. Bass typographical style is just as recognisable as his visual one. With his font appearing almost always in all-caps, with its rough and hand-drawn look he was able to create simple yet powerful visuals.He uses his fonts as a tool to tell stories, communicating tone of voice,formality,importance and structure anong other things.

                        <h2>Logo Design</h2>
                        <p>After a short venture into filmmaking, Saul Bass returned to his graphic design roots, between 1967 to 1991, he designed a series of logos continuing to apply his 3 step approach and retaining his distinctive style and voice. His initial simplistic bell logo design for the company AT&T sparked the interest of many other corporations looking for a rebrand, resulting in bass designing arguably some of the most iconic corporate logos in north America such as, Continental Airlines’ (1968) “Jetstream” logo and United Airlines’ (1974) “tulip” logo, Kosé Cosmetics (1959), Kibun (1964), Warner Communications (1972) and Girl Scouts (1978) amongst many others we all know today. Saul Bass designs are timeless and stand the test of time with some logos having a lifespan of 34 years. The majority of his designs over the years have only been slightly modified keeping staying true to bass designs.</p>

                            Many of his core design principals can be applied to UX and web design also, from his tactical use of colour theory to create striking, audience capturing images to his experimental typography style.
